### Lead-Score-Case-Study
 This project is created to find the 'Hot Leads' in a Educational Firm . An education selling Company X reaches out to customers to buy their courses.
 The Company needs to easily identify the potential buyers from the rest.
 I am performing a Logistic Regression Model to analyze the Lead Score.
